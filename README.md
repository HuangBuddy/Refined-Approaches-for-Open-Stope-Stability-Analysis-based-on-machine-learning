# Refined-Approaches-for-Open-Stope-Stability-Analysis-based-on-machine-learning
The aim of this project is to introduce new machine learning techniques into the field of open stope stability analysis: By integrating the classification model and genetic programming technique into a platform, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is created to provide decision-making references.
